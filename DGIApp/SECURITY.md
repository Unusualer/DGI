# Security Guidelines for DGI Application

This document outlines security best practices for deploying and maintaining the DGI Application.

## Secure Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never hardcode sensitive information in the codebase
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set secure values
   - Generate a strong JWT secret using: `openssl rand -base64 64`
   - Use different credentials for development, testing, and production

2. **Database Security**
   - Create a dedicated database user with minimal required permissions
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Consider using database connection pooling
   - Enable database encryption at rest

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - Restrict CORS to only necessary domains
   - In production, specify exact origins instead of using wildcards

## Authentication & Authorization

1. **JWT Best Practices**
   - Use a short expiration time for tokens (1-24 hours)
   - Consider implementing refresh tokens for prolonged sessions
   - Regularly rotate JWT signing keys

2. **Password Policies**
   - Enforce strong password requirements
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing (already implemented)

3. **Session Management**
   - The application uses stateless JWT tokens
   - Implement an endpoint for token revocation if needed

## Deployment

1. **HTTPS**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper SSL/TLS settings
   - Use secure ciphers and protocols
   - Consider using HSTS headers

2. **Server Hardening**
   - Keep all software updated
   - Use a firewall
   - Apply principle of least privilege
   - Consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx

3. **Docker Security**
   - Use specific version tags instead of `latest`
   - Run containers as non-root users when possible
   - Set resource limits
   - Scan container images for vulnerabilities

## Monitoring & Response

1. **Logging**
   - Review logs regularly
   - Set appropriate log levels
   - Don't log sensitive information
   - Consider using centralized logging solution

2. **Incident Response**
   - Have a plan for security breaches
   - Document steps to take when vulnerabilities are discovered
   - Regular security testing and reviews

## Regular Maintenance

1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Regularly update all dependencies
   - Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Use tools like npm audit, OWASP Dependency Check, or Snyk

2. **Security Testing**
   - Conduct periodic security reviews
   - Consider penetration testing
   - Use security scanners

## User Data Protection

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Only collect necessary data
   - Implement data retention policies

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries (already implemented with JPA)
   - Implement output encoding to prevent XSS
